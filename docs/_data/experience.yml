  position: Product Specialist
  duration: Mar, 2019 &mdash; Apr, 2020
  summary: Managing the first version of Lokasi Intelligence, essentially becoming a Product Manager, in the name of Product Specialist. The first version of Lokasi Intelligence only had one platform, the main platform. We started small with a simple SDLC flow, direct communication from Sales Team to Product Specialist to Technical Teams.

However, small teams with quick delivery time often consider documentation as low priority, thus making the application itself hard to track. As the one who managed the app, I created a better SDLC flow with agile framework to improve team efficiency and also developing product requirement document standards to then be used as the main document to develop our features.
