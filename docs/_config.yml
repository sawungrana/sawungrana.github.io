resume_header_intro: "<p>Dynamic and forward-thinking Spatial Engineering student at the University of Twente, previously holding over six years of professional experience in the B2B SaaS industry, specializing in GIS and location intelligence systems. With a robust background in product management, I've effectively served clients in the retail, F&B, and FMCG sectors, leveraging geospatial analysis to enhance income, reduce costs, and mitigate risks. My current academic focus in Spatial Engineering stems from a deep-seated desire to bridge the gap between geospatial experts and the general public. Recognizing the need for professionals who not only wield technical expertise but also understand the real-world applications of their tools, I am dedicated to transforming technical solutions into tangible benefits for society.</p>"
